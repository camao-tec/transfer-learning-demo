This notebook implements a simple demo use-case for transfer learning.
The implemenetation is based on [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) and uses a dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhdikshit/neu-surface-defect-database).
Further details and documentation can be found directly in the notebook.
